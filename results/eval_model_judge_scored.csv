Okay, let's see. The problem is to solve for x in the equation 3x + 5 = 20. Hmm, I remember that to solve for x, I need to isolate it on one side of the equation. So first, I should get rid of that 5 that's being added to 3x. How do I do that? Well, if I subtract 5 from both sides of the equation, that should keep things balanced. Let me try that.

Starting with 3x + 5 = 20. If I subtract 5 from both sides, it becomes 3x = 20 - 5. Let me calculate 20 minus 5. That's 15. So now the equation is 3x = 15. Now, I need to get x by itself. Since 3 is multiplied by x, I should divide both sides by 3 to undo that multiplication. 

Dividing both sides by 3 gives me x = 15 / 3. Calculating that, 15 divided by 3 is 5. So x equals 5. Let me check if that makes sense. If I plug x = 5 back into the original",Qwen/Qwen3-0.6B,0

Okay, let's see. The problem is to solve for x in the equation 3x + 5 = 20. Hmm, I remember that to solve for x, I need to isolate it on one side of the equation. So first, maybe I should subtract 5 from both sides to get rid of that constant term on the left. Let me try that.

Starting with 3x + 5 = 20. If I subtract 5 from both sides, that would be 3x + 5 - 5 = 20 - 5. Simplifying both sides, the +5 and -5 on the left cancel out, leaving 3x = 15. So now the equation is 3x = 15. 

Now, to solve for x, I need to divide both sides by 3 because 3 is multiplied by x. So dividing both sides by 3 gives me (3x)/3 = 15/3. That simplifies to x = 5.

Okay, let's see. The problem says that a triangle has a base of 10 and a height of 6. I need to find its area. Hmm, I remember that the formula for the area of a triangle is (base multiplied by height) divided by 2. Let me make sure I recall that correctly. 

So, the formula is Area = (1/2) * base * height. Yeah, that sounds right. The base here is given as 10, and the height is 6. Plugging those numbers into the formula should give me the area. Let me do the multiplication first: 10 times 6. That equals 60. Then, I divide that by 2. 60 divided by 2 is 30. 

Wait, the expert solution says 30, so that's correct. But I need to make sure I didn't mix up any steps. Let me double-check. If the base was 10 and height 6, then yes, multiplying them gives 60, and dividing by 2 gives 30.

Wait, let me make sure. Yes, I think that's right. So if the base is 10, then multiplying that by the height of 6 gives me 60. Then divide by 2, which would be 30. That seems straightforward. 

But wait, is there any chance I mixed up the formula? Like, maybe someone might think it's (base + height)/2 or something else? No, that doesn't make sense. The height is the perpendicular distance from the base, so the formula should be (base * height)/2. 

Let me double-check with an example. If the base was 2 and the height was 3, then the area would be (2*3)/2 = 3, which is correct. So applying the same logic here, 10*6/2 is indeed 30.

Okay, so the problem is asking for the area of a triangle when the base is 10 and the height is 6. Let me think about how to approach this.

First, I remember that the formula for the area of a triangle is (base multiplied by height) divided by 2. So, the formula is Area = (1/2) * base * height. Let me confirm that. Yes, that's right. The base is the length of the base, and the height is the perpendicular distance from the base to the opposite vertex.

In this case, the base is given as 10 units, and the height is 6 units. Plugging these values into the formula should give me the area. Let me write that out: Area = (1/2) * 10 * 6. 

Calculating that, first multiply 10 and 6, which gives 60. Then divide by 2, so 60 divided by 2 is 30. Therefore, the area should be 30 square units.

Okay, let's see. The problem is to find 15% of 80. Hmm, percentages can sometimes be tricky, but I remember that converting a percentage to a decimal is the first step. So, 15% is the same as 0.15 in decimal form. 

Now, to find 15% of 80, I need to multiply 80 by 0.15. Let me do that calculation. 80 multiplied by 0.15. Let me break it down. 80 times 0.1 is 8, and 80 times 0.05 is 4. Adding those together, 8 plus 4 equals 12. So, 12 is the result. 

Wait, let me double-check. If 10% of 80 is 8, then 15% would be 20%, right? Wait, no, 10% is 8, so 15% would be 8 plus 0.5 times 8, which is 8 + 4 = 12. Yeah, that matches. So, 12 is definitely the correct answer.",Qwen/Qwen3-0.6B,0

Okay, let's see. The question is asking for the value of (2^4). Hmm, I remember that exponents mean multiplying the number by itself a certain number of times. So 2 to the power of 4 means 2 multiplied by itself four times. Let me think... 2 times 2 is 4, then 4 times 2 is 8, and 8 times 2 is 16. So that should be 16. Wait, is there any chance I might have confused the exponent with something else? Like maybe 2^4 in a different context? But no, the problem clearly states 2^4. So I think the answer is definitely 16. Let me just double-check. Yeah, 2^4 is 16. No mistakes here. The solution is straightforward.
