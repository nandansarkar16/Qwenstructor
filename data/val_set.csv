0,Bonding,2,"List the following elements in order of increasing electronegativity: O, Ge, C",What happens as you move left to right across a period? What happens as you move down a group?,"**Ge < C < O**

Reason: Electronegativity increases left→right across a period and decreases down a group. Germanium is below carbon in Group 14 (so it’s less electronegative), and oxygen is to the right of carbon in Period 2 (so it’s more electronegative). On the Pauling scale: Ge ≈ 2.0, C ≈ 2.55, O ≈ 3.44.

1,Bonding,12,Indicate the molecular geometry of the following compounds (which disobey the octet rule): a) SF4 b) XeF4 c) PF5 d) SeF6,"Count valence electrons on the central atom, make all single bonds to F, then see how many electrons are left for lone pairs. Convert **(bonds + lone pairs)** to an electron-domain geometry (5 → TBP, 6 → octahedral). Place lone pairs where repulsions are minimized (TBP: equatorial; octahedral: opposite), and read off the molecular shape from the atom positions only.
","Use VSEPR: **steric number = (# bonding regions) + (# lone pairs on the central atom)**.
Electron-domain geometry is set by the steric number; the **molecular** geometry depends on where any lone pairs sit.

**a) SF₄**

* S valence e⁻ = 6. Four S–F single bonds use 4 pairs; remaining 2 e⁻ = **1 lone pair**.
* Steric number = 4 (bonds) + 1 (LP) = **5** → **trigonal-bipyramidal electron geometry**.
* In TBP, a lone pair prefers an **equatorial** site to minimize 90° repulsions.
* Removing the LP from the visible shape gives **seesaw** molecular geometry.
* Angles ≈ 90°, 120°, 180° (slightly distorted by the lone pair).

**b) XeF₄**

* Xe valence e⁻ = 8. Four Xe–F bonds use 4 pairs; remaining 4 e⁻ = **2 lone pairs**.
* Steric number = 4 + 2 = **6** → **octahedral electron geometry**.
* Two LPs in an octahedron go **opposite (trans)** to minimize repulsion.
* Atoms occupy the equatorial plane → **square planar** molecular geometry.
* Angles ≈ 90°, 180°.

**c) PF₅**

* P valence e⁻ = 5. Five P–F bonds; **0 lone pairs**.
* Steric number = 5 + 0 = **5** → **trigonal-bipyramidal** molecular (and electron) geometry.
* Angles ≈ 90° (axial–equatorial), 120° (equatorial–equatorial), 180° (axial–axial).

**d) SeF₆**

* Se valence e⁻ = 6. Six Se–F bonds; **0 lone pairs**.
* Steric number = 6 + 0 = **6** → **octahedral** molecular (and electron) geometry.
* Angles ≈ 90°, 180°.

**Final shapes:**
a) **seesaw** b) **square planar** c) **trigonal bipyramidal** d) **octahedral**

2,Organic Chemistry,10,"For each of the following fatty acids, indicate whether it is saturated or unsaturated. If it is unsaturated, indicate how many carbon-carbon double bonds it contains: a) C13H23COOH b) C13H27COOH","Add the COOH atom counts, then compare its H count to the saturated baseline **CₙH₂ₙO₂** (n = total carbons).","A straight-chain saturated fatty acid with **n** total carbons has the formula **CₙH₂ₙO₂**.
Each C=C double bond lowers the hydrogen count by 2 (so an unsaturated acid with **k** double bonds is **CₙH₂ₙ₋₂kO₂**).

First convert the given “C₁₃H₂₃COOH / C₁₃H₂₇COOH” to full molecular formulas by adding the COOH group explicitly (adds **C₁H₁O₂**):

* **a) C₁₃H₂₃COOH → C₁₄H₂₄O₂.**
  For n=14, a saturated acid would be C₁₄H₂₈O₂. We have H₂₄, which is 4 fewer hydrogens → **2 double bonds**.
  **Answer: unsaturated, 2 C=C.**

* **b) C₁₃H₂₇COOH → C₁₄H₂₈O₂.**
  This matches the saturated formula exactly → **0 double bonds**.
  **Answer: saturated.**

*(Assuming an acyclic chain—no rings.)*

3,Thermochemistry,6,"To change the temperature of a particular calorimeter and the water it contains by one degree Celsius requires 6485 Joules. The complete combustion of 1.40 g of ethylene gas, C2H4, in the calorimeter causes a temperature rise of 10.7 degrees. Find the heat of combustion per mole of ethylene.","Compute the total heat from the temperature rise, convert the burned mass to moles, and divide the total heat by the moles. Don’t forget the negative sign for an exothermic combustion!","Calorimeter heat capacity (C = 6485\ \mathrm{J,^\circ C^{-1}}).
Temperature rise (\Delta T = 10.7\ ^\circ\mathrm{C}).

1. Heat absorbed by the calorimeter–water (equal in magnitude to heat released by the reaction):
   [
   q_{\text{cal}} = C,\Delta T = 6485 \times 10.7 = 6.93895\times 10^{4}\ \mathrm{J} = 69.3895\ \mathrm{kJ}.
   ]

2. Moles of ethylene burned:
   [
   M(\mathrm{C_2H_4}) = 2(12.01) + 4(1.008) = 28.052\ \mathrm{g,mol^{-1}},
   ]
   [
   n = \frac{1.40\ \mathrm{g}}{28.052\ \mathrm{g,mol^{-1}}} = 4.991\times 10^{-2}\ \mathrm{mol}.
   ]

3. Heat of combustion (per mole) = (\displaystyle \frac{|q_{\text{rxn}}|}{n}). The reaction is exothermic, so the sign is negative:
   [
   \Delta H_\text{comb} = -,\frac{69.3895\ \mathrm{kJ}}{4.991\times 10^{-2}\ \mathrm{mol}}
   = -1.39\times 10^{3}\ \mathrm{kJ,mol^{-1}}.

","We want (\Delta H) for:
[
\text{(T)}\quad \mathrm{N_2H_4(l)} + \mathrm{O_2(g)} ;\longrightarrow; \mathrm{N_2(g)} + 2,\mathrm{H_2O(l)} .
]

Use Hess’s law. Combine the given reactions (scaling/reversing as needed) so that all intermediates (NH(_3), N(_2)O, H(_2)) cancel, leaving (T).

A convenient combination is:

* ((1)\times \tfrac14):\quad ( \tfrac12,\mathrm{NH_3} + \tfrac34,\mathrm{N_2O} \to \mathrm{N_2} + \tfrac34,\mathrm{H_2O} ) (\Delta H = \tfrac14(-1010) = -252.5\ \mathrm{kJ})

5,Kinetics,5,"The breakdown of nitrous oxide gas (N2O) to nitrogen gas and oxygen gas is believed to
occur in two steps. In the first step, nitrous oxide breaks down to form nitrogen gas and a
free oxygen atom.
a) Write a balanced equation for the overall reaction (do not use fractional coefficients).
b) Write balanced equations for each of the two steps.
c) Which substance could be considered a ""reaction intermediate?""","First write the simplest overall stoichiometry for N2O turning into N2 and O2 (then clear fractions). For the mechanism, use the clue that a free oxygen atom forms in step 1; design step 2 so that this atom is used up to make O2. The species that appears in steps but cancels in the sum is the intermediate.
","The proposed mechanism says the first step makes an oxygen atom. Let’s construct the overall reaction and a two-step sequence consistent with that.

**a) Overall balanced equation (no fractional coefficients):**
[
\boxed{2,\mathrm{N_2O(g)} ;\longrightarrow; 2,\mathrm{N_2(g)} + \mathrm{O_2(g)}}
]
(This is the integer-coefficient version of (\mathrm{N_2O \to N_2 + \tfrac12 O_2}).)

**b) Balanced equations for the two steps:**

1. Decomposition to make an oxygen atom (as stated):
   [
   \mathrm{N_2O(g)} ;\longrightarrow; \mathrm{N_2(g)} + \mathrm{O(g)}
   ]
2. Consumption of that oxygen atom to form (\mathrm{O_2}):
   [
   \mathrm{O(g)} + \mathrm{N_2O(g)} ;\longrightarrow; \mathrm{N_2(g)} + \mathrm{O_2(g)}
   ]
   Adding (1) and (2) gives (2,\mathrm{N_2O} \to 2,\mathrm{N_2} + \mathrm{O_2}), as required.

**c) Reaction intermediate:**
[
\boxed{\mathrm{O(g)}\ \text{(atomic oxygen)}}
]
It is produced in step (1) and consumed in step (2), and it does not appear in the overall reaction.

6,Liquids & Solids,8,"What are the three types of intermolecular attractive forces and list them in order of
increasing strength?","The first is a form of instantaneous/temporary fluctuations from the movement of electrons. The second is a permanent bond, and the third is a special kind of the second bond when a certain kind of atom is present.","The three main intermolecular attractive forces (for neutral molecules) are:

1. **London dispersion forces** (instantaneous/induced dipoles) – weakest
2. **Dipole–dipole forces** (permanent dipole interactions) – intermediate
3. **Hydrogen bonding** (H bonded to N, O, or F interacting with a lone pair on N/O/F) – strongest

**Order of increasing strength:**
**London dispersion < Dipole–dipole < Hydrogen bonding**

*(Note: Actual strengths can vary with molecular size/shape; dispersion grows with polarizability.)*

7,Acids and Bases,6,"Write a balanced net ionic equation for the reaction between solutions of HNO2
and KOH.
Which 2 species are acting as acids? as bases?","Drop the spectator ion and think Brønsted–Lowry: the weak acid donates H⁺ to hydroxide to make water and its conjugate base. Identify each conjugate pair on opposite sides of the arrow.
","**Reaction type:** weak acid (HNO₂) + strong base (KOH) → neutralization.

1. Write the species in solution and remove spectators (K⁺ is a spectator):

This is already the **net ionic equation** (balanced for atoms and charge).

2. **Acid–base roles (Brønsted–Lowry):**

* **Acids (proton donors):** (\mathrm{HNO_2}) (reactant) and (\mathrm{H_2O}) (product, conjugate acid of (\mathrm{OH^-})).
* **Bases (proton acceptors):** (\mathrm{OH^-}) (reactant) and (\mathrm{NO_2^-}) (product, conjugate base of (\mathrm{HNO_2})).

8,Equilibrium,4,"Consider the following equilibrium:

K is 4.51 x 10-5 at 450 degrees C. Is a mixture containing 100 atm NH3, 30 atm N2, and 500 atm H2 at equilibrium? If not, will the mixture shift toward
product or reactants to achieve equilibrium?","Recall the equilibrium constant in terms of partial pressures and plug in the current pressures to get Q_p (think about how to construct the ratio based on the equilibrium coefficients). Compare (Q_p) to (K_p): if (Q_p<K_p), it shifts right (toward products); if (Q_p>K_p), it shifts left (toward reactants).
","For the gas‐phase equilibrium
[
\mathrm{N_2(g)}+3,\mathrm{H_2(g)}\rightleftharpoons 2,\mathrm{NH_3(g)},
]
the equilibrium constant in terms of partial pressures is
[
K_p=\frac{(P_{\mathrm{NH_3}})^2}{P_{\mathrm{N_2}}(P_{\mathrm{H_2}})^3}.
]

Compute the reaction quotient (Q_p) from the given partial pressures to test equilibrium:
[
Q_p=\frac{(100)^2}{(30),(500)^3}
=\frac{10{,}000}{30\times 125{,}000{,}000}
=\frac{10{,}000}{3.75\times 10^9}

[
Q_p ;(2.67\times 10^{-6}) ;<; K_p ;(4.51\times 10^{-5}).
]

Since (Q_p<K_p), the mixture is **not** at equilibrium and will **shift toward products** (to the right), producing more (\mathrm{NH_3}) and consuming (\mathrm{N_2}) and (\mathrm{H_2}) until (Q_p) increases to (K_p).

Write (K_p=\dfrac{P_{\mathrm{NH_3}}^2}{P_{\mathrm{N_2}}P_{\mathrm{H_2}}^3}) and plug in the **current** pressures to get (Q_p). Compare (Q_p) to (K_p): if (Q_p<K_p), it shifts right (toward products); if (Q_p>K_p), it shifts left (toward reactants).
