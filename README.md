```python  fitness_calculator.py --data_path /vast/palmer/pi/krishnaswamy_smita/hcd22/GPTeacher/data/val_set.csv --prompt_path fixed_eval_adversarial --eval```

# Running an iteration of AutoDAN 
Paths to the original SFT-trained filter, 1-epoch adversarially trained, and fully adversarially trained, are nandansarkar/base_qwen3_0-6B_filter, nandansarkar/qwen3_0-6B_adversarial_1, nandansarkar/qwen3_0-6B_adversarial_final, respectively.
